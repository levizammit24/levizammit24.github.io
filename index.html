<h1> Sprite Sheets and Pixel Art</h1>
<h2> Pixel Art </h2>
<p> Pixel Art is an artstyle most commonly associated with retro video games such as Super Mario Bros., Donkey Kong, Sonic and Pokemon, this is due to the small
     amount of pixels being able to be shown on video game consoles during the era these games were released. Nowadays Pixel Art is no longer just a means to work around 
     limitations in technology but an artistic movement for both some modern video games such as Terraria, Undertale and Stardew Valley, and also art in general.</p>
<p> for most up and coming artists and game designers there are various ways one can create pixel art such as:
<ul><li>Piskel</li>
    <li>Adobe Photoshop</li>
    <li>Pixilart</li>
    <li>Dinopixel</li>
</ul>
But for one to take is a step further and go from artist to game designer, they must also understand Sprite Sheets.</p>
